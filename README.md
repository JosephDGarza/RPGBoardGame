# Summary

This is an RPG web based video game. It is based on the concept of a board game, in that you roll to choose a position on the board.
Which determines your opponent you will face. As with any RPG, RNG(random number generator) is implemented in aspects of dodge, crit
and such. Java is used on the back end. Javascript is used in the front end to perform many functions during the battle scene and to 
pass updated values for variables back to Java.
